CreatorHub AVS provides a streamlined solution for managing and automating tasks in the creator ecosystem.
This project utilizes Solidity, JavaScript, and other technologies to create a comprehensive toolkit for creators.
This application integrates with EigenLayer's Actively Validated Service using zk-fetch technology to securely mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as ownership proofs for YouTube channel creators. The app monitors new tasks, verifies them through zk-proofs, and mints NFTs based on the creator's subscriber tier.


## Overview

CreatorHub implements an Actively Validated Service (AVS) on EigenLayer to provide decentralized creator monetization services by:
1. Leveraging restaked ETH as security for creator verification and content authenticity
2. Operating distributed nodes that validate creator metrics and engagement
3. Implementing middleware services that bridge YouTube data to on-chain states
4. Providing economic incentives for validators through fee sharing and rewards
5. Enabling on-chain monetization opportunities

### EigenLayer Integration
- Integration with EigenLayer's restaking mechanism
- Delegation of restaked ETH as security backing
- Slashing conditions for validator misbehavior
- Registration and management of AVS operators

### AVS Node Operation
- Distributed network of validator nodes
- Consensus mechanism for YouTube metric validation
- Task delegation and proof generation
- Performance monitoring and reporting

## Features

- YouTube channel ownership verification using zero-knowledge proofs
- Automatic NFT minting based on channel statistics
- Integration with EigenLayer for decentralized operation
- Tier-based NFT metadata generation
- Secure proof validation and submission

## The node will:
- Register as an operator in EigenLayer
- Monitor for new validation tasks
- Process YouTube channel verifications
- Mint NFTs for verified channels

## Contract Deployments

The application expects contract deployment files in the following structure:

```
holesky 
```
```
contracts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployments/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ creator-hub/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 17000.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 17000.json
```

## NFT Tiers

The system assigns NFT tiers based on subscriber count:
- Platinum: 10M+ subscribers
- Gold: 1M+ subscribers
- Silver: 10K+ subscribers
- Rookie: 0-10K subscribers

## Install

```sh
